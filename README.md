# EU population data displayed using React-Leaflet

This project was made experimenting with Leaflet/React-Leaflet

Data is taken from eurostats, 2 different datasets.
I am using GeoJson to map out the borders with the Leaflet.
For EU borders check (Eurostat Administrative Units)[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/countries]
Then for population data, I had to download XML and convert it into JSON, and then parse it, data taken from (EU ODP)[https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/O2D9uR8oECoTSCNSLDx3g]

## Interesting point

In one dataset Greece is GR or GRC, however, another dataset had it as EL . Interesting note.
